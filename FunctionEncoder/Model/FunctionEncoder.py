    """A function encoder learns basis functions/vectors over a Hilbert space.

    A function encoder learns basis functions/vectors over a Hilbert space. 
    Typically, this is a function space mapping to Euclidean vectors, but it can be any Hilbert space, IE probability distributions.
    This class has a general purpose algorithm which supports both deterministic and stochastic data.
    The only difference between them is the dataset used and the inner product definition.
    This class supports two methods for computing the coefficients of the basis function, also called a representation:
    1. "inner_product": It computes the inner product of the basis functions with the data via a Monte Carlo approximation.
    2. "least_squares": This method computes the least squares solution in terms of vector operations. This typically trains faster and better. 
    This class also supports the residuals method, which learns the average function in the dataset. The residuals/error of this approximation, 
    for each function in the space, is learned via a function encoder. This tends to improve performance when the average function is not f(x) = 0.
