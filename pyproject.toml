description = """A package for learning basis functions over arbitrary function sets. This allows even high-dimensional problems to be solved via a minimal number of basis functions. This allows for zero-shot transfer within these spaces, and also a mechanism for fully informative function representation via the coefficients of the basis functions. Hilbert spaces are nifty."""
